# TelePads-Minecraft--Spigot-1.14-Plugin
Adds TelePads to Minecraft 1.14 Spigot servers

2 TelePads must be linked together. After they have been linked, you can sneak on the lapis block in the middle to teleport to the other. Each teleport takes fuel (1 gold block per teleport). These need to be placed in a shulker box anywhere on the telepad (except the lapis block because that's where you stand).

**Building a TelePad**

Place down a lapis block. Then surround it with a 3x3 frame of obsidian.
Surround that with a 4x4 frame of diamond blocks, but with gold blocks at the corners.

Then right click the lapis block with a nether star.
The nether star will then be ready for use on a second TelePad.

Build another TelePad somewhere else in the exact same way. Use that same nether star on that one's lapis block.

You now have 2 linked TelePads.

Next place a shulker box anywhere on the TelePad

Then put gold blocks in the shulker box. One gold block is used from this box when you use the TelePad. (Both TelePads will need their own box).

**Using the TelePad**

Sneak on the lapis block to teleport to the linked telepad. This consumes 1 gold block from the shulker box. All players can use the TelePad.

**TelePad Protection**

The TelePad is protected from being destroyed by other players. And the shulker box cannot be accessed by other players. However they will be able to teleport and consume your gold.
